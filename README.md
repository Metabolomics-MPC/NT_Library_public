# MPC MS2 database

Metabolite identification requires high-quality reference libraries obtained from chemical standards. This repository stores the public part of the MPCs reference library containing MS2 and RT information. The library is available in different formats, e.g., MassBank records or .msp files.
The library is generated on two Sciex ZenoTOF 7600 instruments, one for reversed-phase separation and one for hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography-based separation. MS2 spectra are generated with CID and EAD and different collision or kinetic energies, and experts from the MPC manually curate data.
